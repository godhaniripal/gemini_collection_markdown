# Python Lists

Lists are a data structure in Python that can hold multiple items.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

You can access items by index:
```python
first_item = my_list[0]
```

Lists are mutable, meaning you can change them after creation.

Common methods include append(), remove(), and pop().

Lists are useful for storing collections of related data.
